BUILDING CHROME EXTENSION
----------------------------------------------

This script would:
1. Build the React app
2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
3. Copy the manifest.json to the dist folder
4. Copy content and background scripts to the dist folder
5. Create extension icons

For a full implementation, you would use a proper bundler
like webpack or rollup with appropriate plugins.
